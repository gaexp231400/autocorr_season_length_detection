Description: SAZED (Spectral and Average Autocorrelation Zero Distance Density)
    is a package and method for estimating the season length of a seasonal time
    series. SAZED is aimed at practitioners, as SAZED employs only
    domain-agnostic pre-processing and does not depend on parameter tuning or
    empirical constants.
