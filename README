SeasonLength is a Octave/Matlab function for detecting the season length of time series.
An R implementation can be found in the folder 'r'.

The implementation of seasonLength is based on:
Toller, Maximilian, and Roman Kern. "Robust Parameter-Free Season Length Detection in Time Series." 3rd SIGKDD Workshop on Mining and Learning from Time Series (2017).

SAZED is an ensemble method for season length detection, and now available in the R package sazedR.
